# Web-Development-Project
A web application made as a WTL and DBMS miniproject
The "main.html" file is the main menu which leads us to various optional pages.
Every webpage was made using basic HTML and CSS, completely on my own.
Can also be accessed at tesla.productions and tesla.productions/wap

# Main Page- alternatively had background images, navigation bar and a login page
